The Fantastic Weather plugin allows users to create weather devices for Indigo by  providing a bridge between the Dark 
Sky API service and Indigo.

**Dark Sky has been acquired by Apple and is no longer allowing new API sign-ups. The Fantastic Weather plugin will 
remain in the Plugin Store until the API is sunsetted in 2022.**
